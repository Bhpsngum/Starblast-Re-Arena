/* Dev's note

When calling `HelperFunctions.setPlaneOBJ`, if you want to set angle then set rotation like this:
{ x: Math.PI, y: 0, z: -<YOUR ANGLE> }
otherwise just do { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 }
Reason: the plane obj is from neuronality's site, and it's weird

Currently, to use the Ability System (which is bundled with TeamManager and MapManager) in any mod:

1. Clone this Repository to your machine and navigate to that folder
2. Tune the files inside the "files" directory by your choice
The files below are recommended and better don't touch other files unless you know what you're doing
    - Config.js
    - Abilities.js
    - Maps.js
    - Teams.js
    - Commands.js (if you understand it, or else don't)

3. Paste your current's mod code in the templates/gameLogic.js file
Consider the things below:
// Make some terminal commands (optional)
// It's made automatically when DEBUG = true, but if you want to manually make it anyway
MAKE_COMMANDS();

// to initialize the Ability System (required):
AbilityManager.initialize()

// to get ship codes to put in `this.options`:
this.options = {
    reset_tree: true,
    ships: [
        // Your other ships, yous must include the 101 since ability manager won't make you one
        AbilityManager.getShipCodes()
    ]
}

// Note that it will initialize first if it hasn't yet

// Control the tick
this.tick = function (game) {
    AbilityManager.globalTick(game);
    // your stuff here
}

// make sure to set
//    - `game.custom.abilitySystemEnabled` to `true` 
//    - `ship.custom.kicked` to `false` (it should be by default)
// so that ship can use the abilities

// Control the event
this.event = function (event, game) {
    AbilityManager.globalEvent(event, game);
    // your stuff here
}

4. Install NodeJS and NPM if you haven't yet
5. Open terminal/console, move to the folder in step 1 (use cd command or whatever you want)
6. Run `npm run compile main`
7. Profit

8. You might want to keep the files you've modified and replace them with original files
if you clones/pull the updates next time
9. Also if you have enough experience with Node and related stuff,
you can fck around and find out how to compile custom templates as well
