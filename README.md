# Re:Arena
Remake of Arena Mod (aka Arena Mod Recontinuation)

## What's this?
This is the remake of Arena Mod, after development was stopped by the original developers.

However, to make the mod more customizable and organized, I remade this mod with the help from the community.

This remake is only in the early stages, so do prepare for tons of hidden bugs, which I may ~~or may not~~ detect and fix in the future.

But at least it should run as expected ~~I guess~~

### Why so many files and not a single file?
Welp, actually at first, the remade was conducted only on a single file as usual, but when it reached 5k+ lines, i had some problems with it:
* Navigating between parts of codes takes a long while and it's inconvenient
* This remake is intended for everyone to be able to edit the ship abilities and some other configurations. Editing on 5k+ lines is actually a true pain
* Creating different versions with it and updating them at the same time takes too many braincells (even more than the only braincell i have)
* I hate putting everything on just a single file (based developer moment)

To deal with it, at first I decided to load files like how libraries and packages works on NodeJS. BUT, since I was also publishing mods to MS before, there was a time I did tried loading Rumble maps like that, and Gilles said:

> "Please include everything in a single file"

So, the library-loading way surely doesn't work

But then, I had a look over Starblast Prototypes (SP) by UranusOrbiter (It's actually insane, you guys should [check it as well](https://github.com/Bhpsngum/Uranus-Starblast-Prototypes)). What he did to deal with the files was to create a "taper" to assemble code parts into a single file.

Yep, that works.

But uh, I can't just yoink the "taping" code from him because SP is not AMR and vice versa. So I created a custom "taper" by myself.

And based on that, I made mod templates, which are basically "Ability System" but can be used to create mods on your preferences. You can take a look [here](/files/templates/).
