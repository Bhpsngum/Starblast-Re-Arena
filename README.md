# Arena-mod-remake
Remake of Arena mod (aka Arena Mod Recontinuation)

## What's this?
This is the remake of Arena Mod, after development was stopped by the original developers.

However, to make the mod more customizable and organized, I remade this mod with the help from the community.

This remake is only in the early stages, so do prepare for tons of hidden bugs, which I may ~~or may not~~ detect and fix in the future.

But at least it should run as expected ~~I guess~~
