# Arena-mod-remake
Remake of Arena mod (aka Arena Mod Recontinuation)

## What's this?
This is the remake of the old Arena Mod, which its development has been stopped by its original developers.

However, to make the mod more customizable and organized, I remake this mod with the help from the community.

This remake is only in the early stage, prepare for tons of hidden bug, which I may ~~or may not~~ detect and fix in the future.

But at least it should run as expected ~~I guess~~

**P/S:** This won't be the final code since there will be more future updates. Also, since this remake is aiming for Modding Space (MS), a (very) large amount of inappropiate text needs to be removed beforehand. But that'll be done in the future. Bug fixing and updating are still the main focus for now.
